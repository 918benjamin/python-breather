This is a simple script I wrote to practice some basic Python ideas.

Run this script to practice simple breathing exercises right in the terminal. Use the command line and instructions in the script to pick a preset breathing exercise or design your own.

Future todo list (& ideas for improving):
- Figure out a way to run this in the browser so people can use it outside the terminal
